# DeepFace Face Recognition

![Facial Recognition](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400?text=Facial+Recognition+Project) <!-- Replace with an actual image if you have one -->

## 📖 Overview
The **Facial Recognition** project is an advanced implementation of facial recognition and analysis using the DeepFace library. This project leverages deep learning techniques to detect faces in images or live video, providing real-time insights such as emotion, age, gender, race, and facial landmarks.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - **Facial Recognition**: DeepFace
  - **Image Processing**: OpenCV
  - **Data Handling**: NumPy, Pandas
  - **Visualization**: Matplotlib

## 📊 Project Structure
- **Facial_recognition.ipynb**: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the code for facial recognition and analysis.
- **Data**: Directory containing images used for testing the model (if applicable).
- **Results**: Directory for output images and analysis data.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the following libraries:
```bash
pip install deepface opencv-python numpy pandas matplotlib
```
## 🛠️ Running the Project
### Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Facial_recognition.git
cd Facial_recognition
```
### Open the Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook Facial_recognition.ipynb
```
#### Follow the instructions in the notebook to run the facial recognition and analysis algorithms.
## 🎯 Features
*Face Detection:* Utilizes DeepFace and OpenCV to detect faces in images or live video.
*Facial Analysis:* Provides insights such as emotion, age, gender, race, and facial landmarks using DeepFace.
*Real-Time Analysis:* Captures live photos at a specified interval and displays real-time analysis results.
*Visualization:* Displays detected faces and analysis results using Matplotlib.
## 📈 Results
Real-Time Analysis
The project includes real-time analysis capabilities, capturing images at specified intervals and providing immediate feedback on detected faces. Below are examples of the output images with their corresponding analysis results:
### Example 1
Example Image 1<!-- Replace with actual image URL or upload to your repo -->
Emotion:* Neutral
Age:* 27(Changes with lighting and expression)
Gender:* Male
### Example 2
Example Image 2<!-- Replace with actual image URL or upload to your repo -->
*Emotion:* Happy
*Age:* 31(Changes with lighting and expression)
*Gender:* Male
